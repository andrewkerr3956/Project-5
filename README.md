# Project 5

**LINK TO THE LIVE PROJECT: https://pacific-plains-96373.herokuapp.com** <p />

Name: Andrew Kerr <p />

Overview/Description: This project is a basic forum app that supports every basic feature any forum app should have, including asking and answering, and editing and deleting questions. Need some help or advice on something? Just find the category that supports your question the best and ask away! You can also browse through questions that other people may have asked and provide your own answers to them! Try answering if you have a solution in mind, you might even earn some points for being marked as the correct answer! (Please note: the points don't actually do anything as of right now). <p />

Functionality: <br />
[Login]: A simple login page that will display an error if the Username and Password do not match. <br />
[Register]: A simple register page that allows the user to register an account. If the account already exists, it will alert you saying that. If the passwords do not match it will display an error message. <br />
[Profiles]: Profiles display the username, points, and a list of the questions that the user has asked on the app. You can access these profiles by clicking your username in the header, or by clicking the usernames of people throughout the app. <br />
[Points]: Points are a minor feature to resemble how impactful a user is to the community. If you answer a question correctly, you are rewarded with 5 points. Points are not redeemable. <br />
[Questions]: Click a category to view the questions associated with that category. You can only view questions and answers while logged out. If you are logged in, you can post a question in the category of your choice, answer a question, and be awarded points for answering correctly! You can also always delete or edit your question or answer if needed. <p/>


Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js (create-next-app), MySQL, Heroku

Future Improvements: Add a points shop, award some badges for good deeds being done in the community, allow select users to add categories, always can use more touch-ups to the design, etc.
